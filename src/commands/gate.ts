// ─── The gate every write passes through ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Shared by every write command so there is exactly ONE place that decides a
// human approved something. A second copy of this logic would be a second
// policy, agreeing with the first only by luck and diverging on the first edit.
//
// The ordering is the safety design:
//
//   1. account for the spend BEFORE asking, so a refused budget never reaches
//      a prompt the user cannot act on
//   2. ask, and require a token derived from the payload
//   3. commit the spend only after approval — an aborted write costs nothing
