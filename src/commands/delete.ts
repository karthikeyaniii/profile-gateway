// ─── Deleting a post ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The only irreversible action in the tool. Everything else it does can be
// undone: an unwanted post can be deleted, a reaction removed, a cached row
// purged. A deleted post is gone, and no confirmation prompt can give it back.
//
// So this one does something the others do not: it READS THE POST FIRST and
// shows the human the actual text they are about to destroy. A urn is not
// something anyone can eyeball — `urn:li:activity:7489428563075637248` and
// `urn:li:activity:7489428563075637249` are the same string to a tired person
// at a terminal, and one of them is the wrong post.
//
// The lookup is `my-posts`, which is the right source for three reasons at
// once: it proves the post exists, it proves the OWNER wrote it (it came from
// their own posts), and it carries the text. A post that is not in there is not
// necessarily someone else's — it may just be older than the page we fetched —
// so that case is reported rather than refused, and the prompt says plainly
// that it is proceeding blind.
