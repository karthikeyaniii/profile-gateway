// ─── The write gate ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `--confirm` is not a human confirmation. In this family the agent IS the
// process invoking the CLI — Claude Code shells out — so a flag is written by
// the acting party about its own action. It documents intent and obtains
// consent from nobody.
//
// So a write stops and asks, at the moment of the write, having first shown
// exactly what it will do and what it risks. The properties that make this a
// real boundary:
//
//   * No TTY, no write. Run non-interactively — which is how an agent invokes
//     the CLI — and it returns CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED having made ZERO network
//     calls. This is the load-bearing one.
//   * A short token derived from the payload, so `yes | profile-gateway share …` fails.
//   * Only this module can mint a ConfirmedWrite, so the guarantee lives in the
//     type system rather than in a forgettable `if`.
//   * No --yes, no env var, no config setting.
//
// Stated honestly: a TTY check is an ACCIDENT-PREVENTION barrier, not proof of
// human identity — an agent with terminal control can allocate a pty. Its real
// value is moving circumvention from accidental (append a flag) to deliberate
// (construct a pty and echo a payload-specific token). Overclaiming
// unforgeability is how a guard stops being maintained.
