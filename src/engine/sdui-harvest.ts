// ─── Harvesting the tokens a comment needs ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Commenting needs two things that a reaction does not: a `trackingId` from the
// feed render, and an opaque `commentBoxStateId` binding key. Both live in the
// rendered post page, and that page is a PLAIN AUTHENTICATED GET — no browser,
// no CDP. The parser is based on a verified live response.
//
// Scraping a rendered page is the most drift-prone thing in this codebase, so
// the design leans on one lucky property: the binding key CONTAINS the post id.
//
//   commentBoxText-<base64(post id)><31 opaque bytes><FeedType_…>
//
// The first segment is the activity id, zigzag-encoded as a protobuf sint64.
// That means a harvested key can be PROVEN to belong to the post we intend to
// comment on, rather than trusted because of where it was found. A feed page
// carries comment boxes for many posts; picking the wrong one would post a
// comment on a stranger's update under the owner's name. The id check makes
// that structurally impossible instead of merely unlikely.
