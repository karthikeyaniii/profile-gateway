// ─── Operation contracts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every endpoint we call, as DATA — never inline in request logic. queryIds and
// decorationIds are pinned to LinkedIn's deployed web-client build and can
// rotate; keeping them here means a rotation is a data edit, not a code hunt.
//
// Each contract carries its provenance and the date it was captured, and
// `shippableContracts()` admits only `verified` ones. That rule is mechanical
// rather than a convention someone has to remember:
//
//   verified    returned 200 on this machine, on the date recorded
//   discovered  seen in live traffic (a browser network trace) but never exercised
//   inferred    from documentation or another client — may be archaeology
//
// The cost of getting this wrong is documented: `identity/profiles/{id}/
// profileView` was the reference client's core profile endpoint, was documented
// as working in November 2024, and returns 410 Gone today. It is kept below,
// marked dead, so nobody re-adds it from an old blog post.
//
// Refresh with: bun run a browser network trace <path>
