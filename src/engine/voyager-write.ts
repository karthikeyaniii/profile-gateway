// ─── The unsanctioned write transport ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Writing over Voyager, with the same two cookies the reads already use.
//
// This exists because the sanctioned path has a prerequisite not everyone can
// meet: `w_member_social` needs a registered developer app, which needs an
// associated LinkedIn *Page*. Someone with no company has no Page, and so no
// legitimate way to post to their own feed from their own tools. That is a real
// gap, not a hypothetical one.
//
// the original design preferred OAuth as the sole write transport, with the rule:
// "if OAuth cannot perform an operation, omit the command — never fall back to
// Voyager SILENTLY." This is the non-silent version of that fallback, and the
// distinction is the whole design:
//
//   - OAuth is still preferred whenever a token exists. This is the fallback,
//     not the default (see commands/write.ts).
//   - The confirmation prompt names the transport, so the human approving the
//     write knows which surface it goes over before they approve it.
//   - It is CLI-only and TTY-gated exactly like every other write.
//
// What this buys, honestly: nothing legal. LinkedIn's User Agreement §8.2 bans
// automated posting regardless of how the bytes are produced, so this is not
// "safer" than driving a browser — the research  found the
// contract exposure identical and the technical-detection margin small and
// uncertain in both directions. What it does buy is FAILURE MODE: a raw request
// either returns a status we can read or it doesn't. A script driving the real
// composer can post the wrong text, post twice, or report success on a UI that
// never submitted — and a write is publicly visible under the owner's name.
//
// PROVENANCE OF THE PAYLOAD:
//
//   share   ✅ VERIFIED LIVE 2026-08-13. The body below, sent with the six
//           standard headers and the two cookies, created a real public post
//           on the owner's feed. LinkedIn answered **201 Created**. The shape
//           came from four converging OSS clients  and was
//           right first time.
//
//   delete  Not yet exercised. Best-evidenced operation in the research, but
//           still `repo` evidence.
//
// The 201 is worth recording for a second reason: the classifier accepted only
// 200, because reads never return anything else, so that first successful post
// was reported to the user as FETCH_FAILED — after it had already gone live.
// Reporting a success as a failure is the worst direction to be wrong here: it
// invites a re-run, and the re-run posts twice. See classify.ts.
